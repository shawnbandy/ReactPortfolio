# React Portfolio

## Application Specifics

1. This application uses a mobile-first design and gives a developer background for me, Shawn Canavan. 
2. You can find my LinkedIn, GitHub, Codewars, and Resume in the header. 
3. The body contains pictures of me, my academic background, professional history, person information, and future plans. 
4. To give the viewer an example of my early code, there is a coding problem from Codewars along with my solution. 
5. The coding problem was developed into a game, which you can play right below the example. 
6. Finally my footer has some social media, email, navigation to other sections, and copyright information.
